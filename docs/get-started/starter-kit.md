# @sagejs/starter-kit

This project is heavily inspired by [@opengovsg/starter-kit](https://github.com/opengovsg/starter-kit), which provides a speedy, but opinionated way for developers to get started building a new service.

I wanted to build something similar, but with a few differences:

* I like Nuxt, so here we are.

By the way, Open Government Products is a great place to work. You should check them out.

### Env validation

Unlike `@opengovsg/starter-kit`, env is handled through Nuxt's runtime configuration feature, instead of using `process.env`.

## Boom ðŸ’¥

Okay, enough hype. Let's get started.
